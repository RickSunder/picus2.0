Even while being part of multiple groups it's important to share your life with the other group members. What would be a better platform than the user-friendly PicUs? <p></p>Sharing pictures or gifs with a group that you're part of, thats what we stand for. The process is simple: make an account, make a closed group and invite others to join it. Then you can share your images with the others. You can also make an open group, called an event. Everyone with the event link can see and post pictures of the event. Just try it out yourself!</fontsize></h5>
